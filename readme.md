# Blurry Transparent Background Tkinter
![Blurry transparent background on Tkinter demo](assets/demo.png)

This showcase is a code to make a blurry transparent background on tkinter on multiples windows versions and also other os. 
> When you move the window, the blur effect will be delayed because pillow is slow.

Just run blurry.py, you can edit it for more options.
##### If anyone can modify the code during a commit to optimize the instant blur effect, that would be great.
